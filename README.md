# Hi! I'm albmart2

### I'm a student at 42 Madrid!

I'm Alba Martín Muñoz, an enthusiastic student at 42 Madrid.

During my time at 42, I've had the privilege of immersing myself in a unique learning environment where collaboration, experimentation, and critical thinking are fundamental to the educational process. From day one, I've been challenging myself to overcome obstacles and expand my technical skills.

This GitHub space will serve as a showcase of my projects, both those I'm working on at 42 and other personal projects I'm developing. I hope you find inspiration in my creations, and that we can learn together on this exciting journey towards mastery in programming.

Thank you for visiting my page, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work. Together, we can build a more inclusive and diverse future in technology!
